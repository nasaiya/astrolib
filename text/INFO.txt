This template was created for personal use. You may tweak it as you like.
Normally it should be located under
~/.local/share/kdevappwizard/templates/cpp_shraredlibrary

These CMakeLists only provide a basic skeleton to build one or multiple shared libraries.
One can build a shared lib from multiple sources or build multiple libs from many sources.
If you wish to build more than one library, then you should edit CMakeLists.txt in src dir
and append the next target (library) that you want to build:

set(SECOND_LIB
    second_lib.cpp
    second_lib1.cpp
    )

add_library(NameForSecondLib SHARED ${SECOND_LIB})

You may set it's properties like the first library:

set_target_properties(NameForSecondLib
                    PROPERTIES
                    VERSION 0.x
                    SOVERSION 0
                    )

You can install it (in Unix) if you want:
install(TARGETS FIRST_LIB SECOND_LIB
        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
        )
Add as many targets, as the number of libs you want

The header files should be placed inside include/projectname dir.
If you need to create subdirs in there and create header files, they might not get installed.

Read the CMakeLists.txt's to understand how the installation works and edit them as you like.

Last but not least, the root CMakeLists.txt, detects only GCC/LLVM compilers and
forces some flags. It also enables via cmake configuration some others. Edit as you like.

Feel free to use this template for whatever purpose or improve it and share it again!
